"Order Up" is a mock food ordering app created by Liam Guenther as a demonstration of development ability. 

Like any Angular project, be sure to run
> npm install

to install the dependencies.

The Angular app expects a mock back-end in the form of a json-server. Start the json server with
> json-server --watch .\src\app\assets\data\data.json

If needed, install jason-server with
> npm install json-server

start the Angular front end with
> ng server
or
> npm run start

To pass the app's login page you can create a new user, or use an existing one. An example existing user is:
username: bob@gmail.com
password: bobRules
